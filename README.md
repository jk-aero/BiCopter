# BiCopter
This is a custom-built bicopter inspired by hexagonal geometry, using lightweight 3D-printed parts and skew sticks for structure. It runs on a Teensy 4.1–based custom flight controller with a BNO055 IMU for stabilization. The main goal of the project is to learn how to design and program a flight controller.
